This project is made using extensive use of tensorflow and react library for Javascript. The hand tracking model is deployed in the web browser using these extensions.

## React JS

React is javascript library that is used for building user interface for websites. The advantage of using react is that it helps in creating complex UI by combining isolated pieces of code called components. This makes the UI simple and efficient. React helps in changing and re-rendering components on change of data.

## Tensorflow.js

Tensorflow.js is a library of javascript by tensorflow developers at google to allow javascript users train and deploy machine learning models. It enebles the deployment of realtime machine learning and deep learning models directly on web browser. It also provides a number of pretrained models one of which is used on the project.
