# Handtracking using Tensorflow Javascript models and React.

This project is made using extensive use of tensorflow and react library for Javascript. The hand tracking model is deployed in the web browser using these extensions.

## React JS

React is javascript library that is used for building user interface for websites. The advantage of using react is that it helps in creating complex UI by combining isolated pieces of code called components. This makes the UI simple and efficient. React helps in changing and re-rendering components on change of data.

## Tensorflow Javascript models

Tensorflow.js is an open source library by google that helps in deploying machine learning onto a web browser. Javascript which is used widely in web development can also train, test, or run existing ML models thanks to tensorflow. Another added advantage of Tensorflow.js, is that it contains a number of pre trained models that can be used in a website with a few lines of code, eliminating the need or resourses and time for training ML model.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
